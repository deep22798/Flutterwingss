1. In the center of the Firebase console's project overview page, click the Android icon (plat_android) to launch the setup workflow.
   If you've already added an app to your Firebase project, click Add app to display the platform options.

2. Enter your app's package name in the Android package name field.

  • Make sure that you enter the ID that your app is actually using. You cannot add or modify this value after you register your app with your Firebase project.

  • Find this package name in your module (app-level) Gradle file, usually app/build.gradle (example package name: com.yourcompany.yourproject).

3. (Optional) Enter other app information as prompted by the setup workflow.

  • App nickname: An internal, convenience identifier that is only visible to you in the Firebase console

  • Debug signing certificate SHA-1: A SHA-1 hash is required by Firebase Authentication (when using Google Sign In or phone number sign in) and Firebase Dynamic Links.

4. Click Register app.
