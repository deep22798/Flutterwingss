1. In the Firebase console, click Add project, then select or enter a Project name.

If you have an existing Google Cloud project, you can select the project from the dropdown menu to add Firebase resources to that project.

2. (Optional) If you are creating a new project, you can edit the Project ID.

Firebase automatically assigns a unique ID to your Firebase project. Visit Understand Firebase Projects to learn about how Firebase uses the project ID.

After Firebase provisions resources for your Firebase project, you cannot change your project ID.
To use a specific identifier, you must edit your project ID during this setup step.

3. Click Continue.

4. (Optional) Set up Google Analytics for your project, which enables you to have an optimal experience using any of the following Firebase products:

  • Firebase Crashlytics
  • Firebase Predictions
  • Firebase Cloud Messaging
  • Firebase In-App Messaging
  • Firebase Remote Config
  • Firebase A/B Testing

When prompted, select to use an existing Google Analytics account or to create a new account.
If you choose to create a new account, select your Analytics reporting location, then accept the data sharing settings and Google Analytics terms for your project.

You can always set up Google Analytics later in the Integrations tab of your settings Project settings.

5. Click Create project (or Add Firebase, if you're using an existing Google Cloud project).

Firebase automatically provisions resources for your Firebase project. When the process completes, you'll be taken to the overview page for your Firebase project in the Firebase console.
